USAGE
-----

It’s very simple to use a library, which can be downloaded as a one CSS file
and added to your project to use one of many predefined animations by adding
a class to an element.

You can customize selected animations by setting the delay and speed
of the effect. It’s possible to use animations with pure HTML and CSS projects,
but you can also implement Javascript as well.


BASIC USAGE
===========
Simply add `data-aos` attribute to element, for example:
`<div data-aos="animation_name"></div>` in your html.

For example:

<div data-aos="fade-zoom-in"
data-aos-offset="200"
data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine"
data-aos-duration="600">
</div>
